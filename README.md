# Windows-update-powershell-script
I am not a coder or dev engineer, I am new to infrastructure as a code engineer (junior) and this will be my first ever script I build. The reason I have put it on GitHub is because my teacher recommend to, due to the large friendly community that will help with new commits to the script if I done something wrong.

Its quite a difficult script I am trying to write/achieve but I will get there :-)
